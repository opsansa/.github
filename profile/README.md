## What is Opsansa?
Opsansa Inc. is the company behind Casa Pro; an AI software solution focused on automating offsite operations for real estate businesses -- though we quickly saw the broader potential of integrated AI systems across industries.

Born from the ashes of the UKs first AI rental agent (used by many thousands monthly), we began to see that the orchestration of multiple Large Language Models meant we could automate complex business tasks beyond renter experience.

For property managers, brokerages and hospitality operators many common threads emerged... with one clear starting point. Automating support operations to improve satisfaction and give deep oversight for decision makers. This wasn't just "AI customer support", but instead we actually performed administrative tasks across their productivity & property software. 

Opsansa built the first _real_ omnichannel solution for maintaining communication across email, WhatsApp, iMessage, SMS and phone calls without dropping the call or deferring to a human operator. With our goal being to **get issue resolution down to minutes** instead of days and **free up budget and time for the critical workforce.** 

Our past experience building award worthy AI agents fuelled this bold vision. Now we're certain the future of automated business ops is possible. With evermore of the operational work (think HR, payroll, rent roll etc.) being done by our "System of Agents".

This is the start for Opsansa. 

Ops... And Nothing Semi Automated.

## Previous thoughts on the industry...
In mid-2024 we wrote about Casa Plus and other products we had in development, with a final remark on proptech -- our thoughts back then on personalization and software experience are still apparent in both wider technology trends and our focus with Opsansa.

Whether you're an agent or a home hunter, it's not been a "fun" experience. It might be a while before they consider disrupting themselves with cutting edge technology, like Casa. ðŸ˜‰
